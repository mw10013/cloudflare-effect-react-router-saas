You will be given the name of a file `<FILENAME>`to create. If it's not provided ask for it. 

In your context, there will be selected code from a `functions/x/components/ui/oui-*.tsx` file. If it's not provided in your context, ask for it.

Using `functions/x/registry/components/oui-text-field-ex.tsx` and `functions/x/registry/components/oui-dialog-ex.tsx` as templates and guides, create the new file `<FILENAME>` in the `functions/x/registry/components/` directory by extracting the selected code and translating it as necessary to follow the patterns of the templates.
